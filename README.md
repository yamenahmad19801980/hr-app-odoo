////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

I can see from the GitHub Actions page that **GitHub Actions is currently disabled for your account**. This is why you can't see the workflow runs yet.

## üîß **How to Enable GitHub Actions:**

### **Option 1: Contact GitHub Support (Recommended)**
1. **Go to**: https://support.github.com
2. **Click "Contact GitHub Support"**
3. **Select "Account and Profile"** ‚Üí **"Account settings"**
4. **Request**: "Please enable GitHub Actions for my account"
5. **Wait for response** (usually within 24 hours)

### **Option 2: Check Account Settings**
1. **Go to**: https://github.com/settings
2. **Look for "Actions"** in the left sidebar
3. **Check if there are any restrictions** or settings to enable

### **Option 3: Check Repository Settings**
1. **Go to**: https://github.com/yamenahmad19801980/hr-app-odoo/settings
2. **Click "Actions"** in the left sidebar
3. **Look for "Actions permissions"** section
4. **Make sure it's set to "Allow all actions"**

## ÔøΩÔøΩ **Why This Happens:**
- **New accounts** sometimes have Actions disabled by default
- **Account verification** might be required
- **Usage limits** might be reached
- **Account restrictions** from GitHub

## ÔøΩÔøΩ **Alternative: Use Codemagic (No GitHub Actions needed)**

Since GitHub Actions is disabled, let's use **Codemagic** instead - it's actually better for iOS builds:

### **Codemagic Setup (Free & Easy):**
1. **Go to**: https://codemagic.io
2. **Sign up** with your GitHub account
3. **Connect repository**: `yamenahmad19801980/hr-app-odoo`
4. **The `codemagic.yaml` file will be automatically detected**
5. **Click "Start new build"**
6. **Download IPA file** when complete

## üì± **What You'll Get with Codemagic:**
- ‚úÖ **No GitHub Actions needed**
- ‚úÖ **Professional iOS build environment**
- ‚úÖ **Free tier available** (500 build minutes/month)
- ‚úÖ **Automatic builds** on code changes
- ‚úÖ **Easy setup** - just connect your repo

## ÔøΩÔøΩ **Recommended Next Steps:**

1. **Try enabling GitHub Actions** (contact support)
2. **OR use Codemagic** (easier and more reliable for iOS)
3. **Both will give you the same result** - an IPA file for testing

Would you like me to help you set up Codemagic instead? It's actually the better option for iOS builds! üöÄ
